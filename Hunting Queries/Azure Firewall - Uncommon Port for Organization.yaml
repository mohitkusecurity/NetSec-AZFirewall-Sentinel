  'Identifies abnormal ports used in the organization based on learning period activity. This can indicate exfiltration attack or C2 control from machines in the organization by using new a port that has never been used on any machine in the organization.\n\nConfigurable Parameters:\n- Learning period time - learning period for threshold calculation in days. Default is set to 7.'
