name: First Time Source IP to Destination
description: |
  'Identifies the first time a source IP communicates with a destination based on a configurable learning period. This can indicate malicious communication (C2) from machines that never accessed the destination before. This query can also be used for hunting destinations that were never accessed before in the organization, and correlating it with different alerts for higher confidence.
  
  Configurable Parameters:
  
  - Learning period time - learning period for threshold calculation in days. Default is set to 7.'
